<h1>About Us!</h1>

<p class='about'>Bobby's Hobbies was created on October 23rd, 2020 by two UVM Students looking to make it big. Their dream: To create the best hobby shop
in Vermont. After researching the local area for a place to put the shop, they quickly realized that all the best places were taken.
They realized that there was only one place to make their shop where it could be successful, and that place was the world wide web.
Using the skills they acquired in CS148, they set to work creating their shop. The site was complete, but they were still lacking a name.
They decided the only right way to name the site was to envision what their professor would name a hobby shop if he were to ever open one
of his own.</p>

<p class='covid'>During these hard times, Bobby's Hobbies has been taking every precaution to make sure its customers are safe and happy. It's been a
tough year for all of us, but we can get through this as long as you buy our products. Yes the world is in ruin, but please keep
buying those crayons. </p>
